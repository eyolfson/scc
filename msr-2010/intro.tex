\section{Introduction}

Software demands high reliability. However, as its complexity increases, 
modern software inevitably contain bugs, which hurt software reliability.
The modern software development paradigm further complicates the situation: 
Many modern software, e.g., the Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, Apache, and Eclipse, 
are developed by tens to thousands of developers over decades %~\cite{ccomment} 
in a distributed manner. The software often receives tens of housands or hundreds of thousands 
of commits (Section~\ref{sec-results}). 
Developers with different programming experiences, 
different time commitments, different programming styles, from all over the world,
work on the same software project at different times. They join and leave a project 
from time to time over decades.

Therefore, code developed in the modern paradigm has different social characteristics 
that are beyond the code itself. For example, different code segments in the same
software project may be written by developers with  
varies level of expertise, different time 
commitment, different working hours, diverse culture, etc.
The code may be checked in at different times in different time zones. 

Such social characteristics provide a rich and unique source of information for us to 
understand the software and software bugs. Just to name one example, it would be beneficial to know if  
the commit time (e.g., time of day, day of week, etc.) has implications on the qualify of the commit. 
Are commits submitted after midnight buggier than other commits? 
Such correlation results may be useful to predict what commits are more likely
to be buggy so that we can budget more testing effort on these commits, just like prior 
studies~\cite{graves00predicting, guo04robust, Hassan09, libre07, devNetwork08, predictionMenzies10, effort03, ostrand05predicting, 
depGraph08, zimmermann-promise-2007},
which predict buggy locations based on code complexity, 
code locations, the amount of in-house testing, historical data, socio-technical networks, etc. 
Another interesting question is, whether more experienced developers are more or less
likely to write buggy commits. 



%Additionally, it is difficult to know how experienced the developers are in an open source development
%environment as such information is often not documented and subjective. 
%We make our best-effort approximation by calculating the duration of a developer
%contributing to an open source project (i.e., the time between a developer's
%earliest and latest commits to the project), which allows us to discover important findings 
%and implications regarding developers' experience level and code correctness. 

\paragraph{Contributions}
In this paper, we study the social characteristics of modern software to understand 
the correlation between these social characteristics and the correctness of software.  
Specifically, we study the latest versions of the Linux kernel and PostgreSQL with 222,332 and 31,098 commits respectively.
%XXX-XXX millions lines of code, developed over XXX-XXX years. 
We study the correlation between a commit's bugginess
and the time of day of the commit, the day of week of the commit, and
the experience and activity frequency of the commit authors.
%
In addition, we study several other commit characteristics, such as
the comment-only fixes and bug life time. 
%
To the best of our
knowledge, we are the {\bf first} to study the correlation between the commit time of day and
the commit correctness. 

To study the correlation between commit time and commit bugginess, 
we start from {\em bug-fixing commits}, commits that fix software bugs, 
and then leverage the version control system to discover when the corresponding bugs were introduced~\cite{sliwerski-msr-2005}. 
Then we can know collectively when bugs are more likely to be introduced. 

It is difficult to find bug-fixing commits in the sea of software commits.
The prior work~\cite{sliwerski-msr-2005} considers a commit whose commit message contains a bug 
ID that links to a bug report in a bug database to be a bug-fixing commit. While this
approach works for some software such as Mozilla, it does not work for software whose commit messages
rarely contain links to bug reports, e.g., the Linux kernel.
As shown later, only 2.3\% of the bug-fixing commits in the Linux kernel are linked to a bug report.
We address this problem by applying heuristics 
to scan commit messages and do not reply on the links between bug commits and bug reports at all to extract bug-fixing commits.
Our heuristics have a precision of \postP-\linuxP in identifying bug-fixing commits (Section~\ref{sec-results}).

Our major findings are summarized below (Detailed discussions of these findings and their implications are 
presented in Section~\ref{sec-results}): 
%($\S$ denotes in which section the finding and its {\em implications} are discussed).

\vspace{0.05in}
\item {\bf Finding 1:}
%($\S$\ref{sec:finding1}):} 
Commits that are checked into the software repository around midnight (between 0:00-4:00 AM) 
are more likely to be incorrect than average, while commits in the morning 7:00 AM-noon 
are more likely to be correct.
The result indicate that developers may want to double check the code they write for these 
late-night commits (0:00-4:00 AM).
%before they commit between these hours. 
It may also be beneficial for the version control
system to warn the developers of late-night commits to improve software reliability. 

\item {\bf Finding 2:}
% ($\S$\ref{sec:finding2}):} 
In contrast to the prior finding that Friday commits are buggier~\cite{sliwerski-msr-2005}, 
our results on the Linux kernel and PostgreSQL show that 
the bugginess differences of commits that are checked in on different days of week 
are not statistically significant. This result shows that the day of week of commits
vary for different software projects, implying that the bugginess prediction based on this 
metric may need to be on a project-by-project basis.

\item {\bf Finding 3:}
% ($\S$\ref{sec:finding3}):} 
Developers who commit to the repository on a daily basis
write less buggy commits, while day-job developers are more likely to produce
bugs.
%indicating ...
%that we may want to have daily committing developers code-review other developers' commits.

%Developers spend a large amount of time
%diagnosing bugs and fixing bugs by applying patches over the buggy software versions. 
%As modern software are often very complex and developed by thousands of developers 
%in a distributed fashion over many years, many of the patches are not correct, e.g., not fixing
%the bug, or introducing new bugs, etc~\cite{}. A recent study shows that XXX\% of patches
%are buggy.
