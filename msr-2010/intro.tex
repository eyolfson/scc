\section{Introduction}

Software demands high reliability. However, as software complexity increases, 
bug counts and rates inevitably also rise, which hurt software reliability.
The modern software development paradigm further complicates the situation: 
many modern software projects, including the Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, 
Apache, and Eclipse, 
are developed by tens to thousands of developers over decades %~\cite{ccomment} 
in a distributed manner. The software often receives tens of housands or hundreds of thousands 
of commits (Section~\ref{sec-results}). 
Developers with different programming experience, 
different time commitments, different working hours, different programming styles, and even diverse cultures from all over the world,
work on the same software project at different times and in different time zones. They join and leave projects 
at their own pace over periods of decades. 
Code developed in the modern paradigm can therefore have different 
social characteristics than older, more homogeneously-developed projects;
these characteristics can best be measured by going beyond the code itself and 
into code repositories.

Social characteristics provide a rich and unique source of information for us to 
understand software and its bugs. As an example, it would be helpful to know if  
a commit's timestamp (including features such as time of day, day of week, etc.) affects the quality of that commit---are commits submitted after midnight buggier than other commits? 
Such correlations may be useful for predicting what commits are more likely
to be buggy so that we can budget more testing effort on these commits, just like prior 
studies~\cite{graves00predicting, guo04robust, Hassan09, libre07, devNetwork08, predictionMenzies10, effort03, ostrand05predicting, 
depGraph08, zimmermann-promise-2007},
which predict buggy locations based on code complexity, 
code locations, the amount of in-house testing, historical data, socio-technical networks, etc. 
A second interesting question is whether more experienced developers are more or less
likely to write buggy commits. 



%Additionally, it is difficult to know how experienced the developers are in an open source development
%environment as such information is often not documented and subjective. 
%We make our best-effort approximation by calculating the duration of a developer
%contributing to an open source project (i.e., the time between a developer's
%earliest and latest commits to the project), which allows us to discover important findings 
%and implications regarding developers' experience level and code correctness. 

\paragraph{Contributions}
In this paper, we study the social characteristics of modern software to understand 
the correlation between these social characteristics and the correctness of software.  
Specifically, we study the latest versions of the Linux kernel and PostgreSQL with 222,332 and 31,098 commits respectively.
%XXX-XXX millions lines of code, developed over XXX-XXX years. 
We study the correlation between a commit's bugginess
and the time of day of the commit, the day of week of the commit, and
the experience and activity frequency of the commit authors.
%
In addition, we study several other commit characteristics, such as
the comment-only fixes and bug life time. 
%
To the best of our
knowledge, we are the {\bf first} to study the correlation between the commit time of day and
the commit correctness. 

To study the correlation between commit time and commit bugginess, we
start from {\em bug-fixing commits}, commits that fix software bugs,
and then leverage the version control system to discover when the
corresponding bugs were introduced~\cite{sliwerski-msr-2005}.  Our
methodology enables us to observe when bugs are more likely to be
introduced.  Note that we simply use ``bug'' to denote code
that is later changed, even though such code may not objectively be
incorrect; we amplify this discussion later.

It is difficult to find bug-fixing commits in the sea of software commits.
Prior work~\cite{sliwerski-msr-2005} considers a commit whose commit message contains a bug 
ID that links to a bug report in a bug database to be a bug-fixing commit. While this
approach works for some projects, like Mozilla, it does not work for software whose commit messages
rarely contain links to bug reports, like the Linux kernel.
We have observed that only 2.3\% of the bug-fixing commits in the Linux kernel are linked to a bug report.
We address this problem by applying heuristics 
which scan commit messages; they do not rely on any links between bug commits and bug reports to extract bug-fixing commits.
Our heuristics have a precision of \postP-\linuxP in identifying bug-fixing commits (Section~\ref{sec-results}).

Our major findings are summarized below ($\S$ denotes the section where the finding and its {\em implications} are discussed):
%(Detailed discussions of these findings and their implications are 
%presented in Section~\ref{sec-results}): 

\begin{list}{\labelitemi}{\topsep=0pt\parsep=0pt\leftmargin=9pt\itemindent=0pt}

\item {\bf Finding \fbuggy ($\S$\ref{sec-results}):} 
About a quarter (23.7-25.5\%) of all the commits in the Linux kernel and PostgreSQL are buggy, 
and require further developer activities to fix them.

\item {\bf Finding \fhour ($\S$\ref{sec-time-of-day}):} 
Commits that are checked into the software repository around midnight (between 0:00-4:00 AM) 
are more likely to be incorrect than average, while commits in the morning 7:00 AM-noon 
are more likely to be correct.
The result indicate that developers may want to double-check the code they write for these 
late-night commits (0:00-4:00 AM).
%before they commit between these hours. 
It may also be beneficial for the version control
system to warn the developers of late-night commits to improve software reliability. 


\item {\bf Finding \fdaily ($\S$\ref{sec-dev-char}):} 
Developers who commit to the repository on a daily basis
write less buggy commits, while developers who appear to work on a project
as part of their day-job are more likely to produce
bugs, indicating that we may 
want to promote the action of daily commiting developers code-reviewing other 
developers' commits.


\item {\bf Finding \fday ($\S$\ref{sec-day-of-week}):} 
In contrast to a prior finding that Friday commits are buggier~\cite{sliwerski-msr-2005}, 
our results on the Linux kernel and PostgreSQL show that 
the bugginess differences of commits that are checked in on different days of week 
are slight. Our result shows that the bugginess per day-of-week for commits
varies for different software projects, implying that bugginess prediction based on this 
metric may need to be on a project-by-project basis.

\end{list}


%Developers spend a large amount of time
%diagnosing bugs and fixing bugs by applying patches over the buggy software versions. 
%As modern software are often very complex and developed by thousands of developers 
%in a distributed fashion over many years, many of the patches are not correct, e.g., not fixing
%the bug, or introducing new bugs, etc~\cite{}. A recent study shows that XXX\% of patches
%are buggy.
