% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V1.9 April 2009
% This file should be compiled with V2.4 of "sig-alternate.cls" April 2009

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.4) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

%% \comment{In this paper we attempt to find a correlation between the commit time
%% of a code change and the rate of introduction of bugs. In other words,
%% are developers more prone to bug-inducing changes during certain hours
%% of the day or not. Before we start our search we were expecting our
%% results to show that before lunch hour, in anticipation of going for
%% lunch, and towards the end of the working day in anticipation of going
%% home. Previous studies have explored whether there is a correlation
%% between the bug-inducing changes rate and the day of the week, various
%% mining techniques of bug-inducing changes, but to our knowledge no
%% work has been to try and find a specific time slots during the day
%% when developers might be more likely to introduce bugs. We mined data
%% from Linux and Firefox using their software repositories. We developed
%% an automated method for extracting information which finds a patch
%% containing a fix and links it to patches which introduced the bug,
%% which required the fix. We found the false positive rate to be under
%% 20\% after randomly sampling 100 reports. Our study has found that Thursday is a bad day to code, while
%% Mondays are surprisingly good. Also between 12AM and 9AM, developers are more prone
%% to introducing errors, while the least amount of bugs are introduced between
%% 11AM and 3PM. Our data also shows that daily committers are less prone to introducing
%% bugs, while day-job users are more prone. Finally, the bug lifetimes seem to decay
%% exponentially, and on average is longer for larger projects.}
