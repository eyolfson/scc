\section{Results}
\label{sec-results}
In this section, we present the results obtained from carrying out our
methodology, and discuss some of the implications of our results.
Most of our results investigate the effect of an independent variable
(time-of-day and developer experience/frequency classifications) on
the likelihood of a commit to be a bug-introducing commit, or
\emph{bugginess}. We also
describe our findings with respect to the day of the week, which
allows us to compare our results to those
in~\cite{sliwerski-msr-2005}.  Finally, we explain the precision and
recall of our methodology and how we computed these figures.

\paragraph{Project characteristics}
We chose two large open-source software repositories for our
investigations: Linus Torvalds's mainline Linux kernel, from
\url{git.kernel.org} and PostgreSQL, from the project's repository at
\url{git.postgresql.org}.  Table~\ref{tab:characteristics} summarizes
the characteristics of each of our repositories. Note that the
PostgreSQL repository was carefully converted from CVS using {\code cvs2git} in
September 2010. We discussed some of the quirks of the PostgreSQL repository
in Section~\ref{sec:method}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r}

First commit & April 16, 2005 & July 9, 1996 \\

\subsection{Time-of-day Results} 
We first present our results correlating the time-of-day of a commit
with its bugginess.  Figures~\ref{fig-linux-bugginess-hour}
and~\ref{fig-postgresql-bugginess-hour} present results from the Linux kernel and
Postgres, respectively. These graphs compare the time-of-day of each
commit, in the committer's local time on a 24-hour clock, to the
percentage of commits which were found to be bug-introducing. The
solid horizontal line indicates the mean number of buggy commits in
each project; bars shorter than the line indicate that commits at that
hour were less likely to be buggy, while bars taller than the line
indicate hours with more-buggy commits. The graphs also contain the
raw number of commits at each hour, as indicated by the red dots.

Both figures show a noticeable increase in the amount of commits which
introduce a bug between 00:00 (midnight) and 04:00 (4AM). After 04:00,
commits tend to be less buggy than average, gradually increasing until
noon.  In the Linux kernel, commits between noon and midnight fluctuate around
the average bugginess level, while the Postgres commits are generally
above the average bugginess level between 16:00 (4PM) and 20:00 (8PM),
and then below the average bugginess level between 20:00 (8PM) and
00:00 (midnight). Note that even the smallest total number of commits,
for any hour, is 139 for Postgres (and an order of magnitude higher
for the Linux kernel), so that all of the depicted bug introduction rates are
meaningful.

Our results suggest that tired developers (midnight-4AM) are more
likely to miss corner cases in a pre-commit review (for Postgres) or
while finalizing the patch (for the Linux kernel). Furthermore, we can observe
that commits before noon are least likely to be bug-introducing;
perhaps committers are most careful in those hours.

\subsection{Developer Characteristics}
We next present our findings with respect to developer classification
and experience.  Developer classification summarizes the frequency of
a developer's contributions to a project, while developer experience
tracks how long a developer has contributed to a particular project.

\paragraph{Developer Frequency Classification} 
As we described in Section~\ref{sec:data}, one of the ways that we
classify developers is according to frequency, i.e. most-common
interval between consecutive commits---daily, weekly, monthly, other,
or single.  This information is only interesting for the Linux kernel, as the
almost all (28/34) of Postgres's committers are daily. We computed the
bugginess rates for each of these classes of developers and plot
author classification versus bug-introduction percentage in
Figure~\ref{fig-linux-bugginess-author-class}. The graph also presents
the number of authors in each class; the Linux kernel has 49 day job authors,
and 238 weekly and 288 monthly authors.

Our results show that the Linux kernel developers who commit changes daily, but
not as their day job, produce the smallest number of bug-introducing
commits, followed by the single-commit authors (whose patches would
presumably be simple or closely-reviewed). The day job, weekly, and
monthly committers all produce slightly more bug-introducing commits
than average.

A possible cause for the difference between day-job and daily
committers is that day-job developers might be required to make
changes by their employers, while the daily developers are motivated
purely by interest, and unlikely to be pressured to fix bugs on any
particular schedule.

% we need to say what the two bars mean in the figure.

%% \caption{Firefox percentage of bug introductions and percentage of total commits per author experience}
%% \label{fig-firefox-experience}
%% \end{figure}

\paragraph{Developer Experience Classification}
The final head-to-head comparison we performed is based on the amount
of experience per author. We divided them up into 6-month intervals. 
Our results from the Linux kernel and Firefox are shown in Figure
\ref{fig-linux-experience} and Figure \ref{fig-firefox-experience}
respectfully. For the Linux kernel authors with less than 2 years of experience
are more likely to commit a bug while after 2 years the likelihood
decreases. However the authors which committed throughout the history
of the project are more likely to commit a bug which may be because
they wrote the majority of the code. For Firefox, again the
developers with less than 6 months of experience are more likely to
commit a bug. The is a spike between 21 and 26 months as well. We
believe these results may not be accurate due to the possiblity of
our experience metric being crude and not representative of the 
actual experience with the project.

%% \begin{center}
%% \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{linux_bug_life.png}
%% \end{center}
%% \caption{Linux number of bugs against bug lifetimes in months}
%% \label{fig-linux-buglife}

%% \end{center}
%% \caption{Firefox number of bugs against bug lifetimes in months}
%% \label{fig-firefox-buglife}
%% \end{figure}

Finally we determined the bug lifetimes for both projects to contrast
them to previous work. We plotted the number of bugs for each lifetime
divided into 4 month intervals. The results for the Linux kernel are shown in
Figure \ref{fig-linux-buglife}, the average bug lifetime is 1.39
years. The results for Firefox are shown in Figure
\ref{fig-firefox-buglife}, with an average bug lifetime of 0.97
years. This shows a reduction in the average bug lifetime for the Linux kernel (in
2002 the average lifetime was 1.8 years). This indicates that
developers are improving as their development process becomes more
refined. We also see the average lifetime is lower for Firefox, this
may be due to the complexity of the software, size of the software or
the amount of users (the more users and complex, the more likely bugs will be
revealed).

\subsection{Day-of-week Results} Having determined our false positive rate, 
we continue by presenting the results of our analysis.  First, we
determine if the day of the week has any impact on the likelihood of
producing bugs. For the following graphs, the percentage of
introduction commits indicates the amount of commits which are bug
introductions, as a propostion of the total number of
commits. Figure~\ref{fig-linux-bugginess-day} presents our results for
the Linux kernel. We see that Saturday is the worst day, followed by Thursday,
while Monday has the fewest percentage of bug introductions. The
results for Firefox are shown in Figure~\ref{fig-postgresql-bugginess-day} and
agree with Thursday being one of the worst days, while Monday is the
best day for committing changes which do not introduce bugs. A
possible explanation is that developers rest over the weekend and have
ample time to think about the problem before coding a solution on
Monday, when they know exactly what to do. Per-day bugginess may also
be correlated with the size of the change, which we plan to investigate
later, as an addition to our technique.

\subsection{Comment-only commits}
We noticed that a surprisingly large number of bug-fixing commits only 
changed comments in the source code.

%% We also noted that approximately 7.7\% of the bug fixes for Linux were
%% purely for comments, indicating that developers spend a non-trivial
%% amount of time on comments. For Linux, approximately 51\% of the
%% changes do not include additions. We therefore manually checked (a
%% subsample of) the 49\% more difficult cases to evaluate the
%% effectiveness of our heuristic for additions.

\subsection{Validation} 
To validate our results, we estimated the precision and recall of our
technique for identifying bug-fixing commits on both projects.  As our
algorithm for identifying the associated bug-introducing commits was a
straightforward application of git blame, we did not systematically
verify its performance. (A brief manual inspection of bug-introducing
commits looked correct.) For both projects, we randomly sampled 50 bugs
from each of the population of commits that we identified to be
bug-introducing commits BI (to evaluate precision) and commits that we
identified to be non-bug-introducing commits $\neg$ BI (to evaluate recall).
Tables~\ref{tab:pr-raw} and~\ref{tab:pr-adj} summarize our precision and
recall findings.

We evaluated the precision---that is, the proportion of identified
bug-fixing commits which do indeed fix bugs---and found that, for
the Linux kernel, 43 of the 50 bugs that we automatically identified as
bug-fixing commits did indeed fix bugs, while 7 did not; for Postgres,
42 of 50 identified fixes were indeed fixes.  Some of the
cases included: 1) a commit message which fixed a merge commit was
classified as a fix; 2) apparently garbled commit messages which
included the keyword ``fix'' for no good reason; 3) changes which were
reverted (in the alleged ``fix'') but then re-added in a later
version; 4) poor uses of version control systems which included many
different changes in a single commit, including a fix as a small part 
of the commit; and 5) refactoring changes, which moved or renamed
functions---these could arguably be considered to be fixes to a buggy
initial design.

To evaluate the recall of our technique, we sampled 50
non-bug-introducing commits from both the Linux kernel and
Postgres. Table~\ref{tab:pr-raw} presents the raw data. However, the
raw data must be adjusted before it will indicate the recall, because
the recall must be calculated as a proportion of commits over the
entire population of commits. We therefore adjusted our data to the
numbers shown in Table~\ref{tab:pr-adj}.
