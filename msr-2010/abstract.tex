There are many factors which may contribute to patch quality, our goal
is to find these correlations. Previous studies used day of the week
in order to find correlations. We extend this by using time of the day
and author frequency/experience. We discuss the impact of our work
through motivating examples, which may lead to higher quality code.

We implemented a tool for software repositories which determines
bug-fixing and bug-introducing commits. We describe our implementation
and evaluate it on open source projects. Finally, we present our
findings from these projects.

%% First, given a software repository, we extract bug-fixing commits
%% using a keyword search. Then, we automatically determine the
%% bug-introduction commits from this using ``blame''
%% information. Finally, we store this in a database and analyze the
%% commit and author information.
