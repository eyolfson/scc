Modern software is often developed over many years with hundreds of
thousands of commits. Commit metadata is a rich source of social
characteristics, including the commit's time of day, and the
experience and activity level of its author.  The ``bugginess'' of a
commit is also a critical property of that commit.  In this work, we
investigate the correlation between a commit's social characteristics
and its ``bugginess''; such results can be very useful for software
developers and software engineering researchers. For instance,
developers or code reviewers might be well-advised to thoroughly
verify commits that are more likely to be buggy.

In this paper, we study the correlation between a commit's bugginess
and the time of day of the commit, the day of week of the commit, and
the experience and activity frequency of the commit authors.  We
survey two widely-used open source projects: the Linux kernel and
PostgreSQL.  We have discovered several interesting findings, and we
present our findings and their implications in this paper.

%% Our main findings include: (1) commits submitted between midnight and
%% 4 AM are significantly buggier and commits submitted between 7AM - noon
%% are less buggier, implying that developers may want to double check
%% their own midnight commits; and (2) daily commiting developers produce
%% less buggy commits, indicating that we may want to have daily
%% commiting developers code-review other developers' commits.
