- use one consistent name for author activity level/author classification/author frequency
- Check the accuracy of references, particularly the citeseer ones
- Need some literature search regarding studies on developer experience
- sample another 50 commits that we think are not bug-fixing commits for each project to increase recall [lower priority] 
- More metrics like severity, etc, and results [in progress]
- Literature search for number of commits which are comments (Lin) [in progrss]
- Classify commits?
- Per author information, outside of their normal times [in progress]
- Find if time of day and author classification influence bugginess [done graphs]
- Committer vs author (who is reviewing the changes)
- Author experience based on number of other projects
- Variance

- Postgres [done]
- False positive/negative rates [done]
- Make a cutoff number of commits for classification [done]
- Timezone corrections for postgresql (Patrick) [done]
