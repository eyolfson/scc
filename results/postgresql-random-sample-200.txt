Commit: a44174cf907c069679af2d3b21c18420bb51509f
Message:
Fix subselect.c to avoid assuming that a SubLink's testexpr references each
subquery output column exactly once left-to-right.  Although this is the case
in the original parser output, it might not be so after rewriting and
constant-folding, as illustrated by bug #3882 from Jan Mate.  Instead
scan the subquery's target list to obtain needed per-column information;
this is duplicative of what the parser did, but only a couple dozen lines
need be copied, and we can clean up a couple of notational uglinesses.
Bug was introduced in 8.2 as part of revision of SubLink representation.

Message:
Second try at fixing join alias variables.  Instead of attaching miscellaneous
lists to join RTEs, attach a list of Vars and COALESCE expressions that will
replace the join's alias variables during planning.  This simplifies
flatten_join_alias_vars while still making it easy to fix up varno references
when transforming the query tree.  Add regression test cases for interactions
of subqueries with outer joins.

Improve the various elog messages in tuptoaster.c to report which TOAST table

Back-patch to 8.3, but not further because the patch doesn't apply cleanly
further back.  Given the lack of response to my proposal of this, there
doesn't seem to be enough interest to justify much back-porting effort.

Commit: adfeef55cbcc5dc72a772777f88c1be05a70dfee
Merge: False
Message:
When enqueueing after-row triggers for updates of a table with a foreign
key, compare the new and old row versions. If the foreign key column has
not changed, we needn't enqueue the trigger, since the update cannot
violate the foreign key. This optimization was previously applied in the
RI trigger function, but it is more efficient to avoid firing the trigger
altogether. Per recent discussion on pgsql-hackers.

Also add a regression test for some unintuitive foreign key behavior, and
refactor some code that deals with the OIDs of the various RI trigger
functions.

Merge: False
Message:
This patch adds the following to the FTI module:

* The ability to index more than one column in a table with a single
trigger.
* All uses of sprintf changed to snprintf to prevent users from crashing
Postgres.
* Error messages made more consistent
* Some changes made to bring it into line with coding requirements for
triggers specified in the docs.  (ie. check you're a trigger before casting
your context)
* The perl script that generate indices has been updated to support indexing
multiple columns in a table.
* Fairly well tested in our development environment indexing a food
database's brand and description fields.  The size of the fti index is
around 300,000 rows.
* All docs and examples upgraded.  This includes specifying more efficient
index usage that was specified before, better examples that don't produce
duplicates, etc.

COPY performance improvements.  Avoid calling CopyGetData for each input
character, tighten the inner loops of CopyReadLine and CopyReadAttribute,

encodings require slow pg_encoding_mblen() loops.  Also, clean up the
mishmash of static variables and overly-long parameter lists in favor of
passing around a single CopyState struct containing all the state data.

Commit: 220e45bf325b061b8dbd7451f87cedc07da61706
Merge: False
Message:
Improve the planner's simplification of NOT constructs.

This patch merges the responsibility for NOT-flattening into
eval_const_expressions' processing.  It wasn't done that way originally
because prepqual.c is far older than eval_const_expressions.  But putting
this work into eval_const_expressions saves one pass over the qual trees,
and in fact saves even more than that because we can exploit the knowledge
that the subexpressions have already been recursively simplified.  Doing it
this way also lets us do it uniformly over all expressions, whereas
prepqual.c formerly just did it at top level to save cycles.  That should
improve the planner's ability to recognize logically-equivalent constructs.

While at it, also add the ability to fold a NOT into BooleanTest and
NullTest constructs (the latter only for the scalar-datatype case).

Per discussion of bug #5702.

wouldn't be considered removable leading whitespace, it shouldn't be

Commit: 8f9f1986034a2273e09ad10671e10d1adda21d1f
Merge: False
Message:
Restructure subtransaction handling to reduce resource consumption,
as per recent discussions.  Invent SubTransactionIds that are managed like
CommandIds (ie, counter is reset at start of each top transaction), and
use these instead of TransactionIds to keep track of subtransaction status
in those modules that need it.  This means that a subtransaction does not
need an XID unless it actually inserts/modifies rows in the database.
Accordingly, don't assign it an XID nor take a lock on the XID until it
tries to do that.  This saves a lot of overhead for subtransactions that
are only used for error recovery (eg plpgsql exceptions).  Also, arrange
to release a subtransaction's XID lock as soon as the subtransaction
exits, in both the commit and abort cases.  This avoids holding many
unique locks after a long series of subtransactions.  The price is some
additional overhead in XactLockTableWait, but that seems acceptable.
Finally, restructure the state machine in xact.c to have a more orthogonal
set of states for subtransactions.

No, I do not care whether Coverity considers this a memory leak.

Merge: False
Message:
When using a junkfilter, the output tuple should NOT be stored back into
the same tuple slot that the raw tuple came from, because that slot has
the wrong tuple descriptor.  Store it into its own slot with the correct
descriptor, instead.  This repairs problems with SPI functions seeing
inappropriate tuple descriptors --- for example, plpgsql code failing to
cope with SELECT FOR UPDATE.

Message:
* make pg_hba authoption be a set of 0 or more name=value pairs
* make LDAP use this instead of the hacky previous method to specify
  the DN to bind as
* make all auth options behave the same when they are not compiled
  into the server
* rename "ident maps" to "user name maps", and support them for all
  auth methods that provide an external username

This makes a backwards incompatible change in the format of pg_hba.conf
for the ident, PAM and LDAP authentication methods.

Message:
Buy back some of the cycles spent in more-expensive hash functions by
selecting power-of-2, rather than prime, numbers of buckets in hash joins.
If the hash functions are doing their jobs properly by making all hash bits
equally random, this is good enough, and it saves expensive integer division
and modulus operations.

Commit: 109d50dd35db93a9d6c50bcbe2481518c3789829
Merge: False
Message:
Under new theory of operation wherein postmaster forks children
immediately, we will fork a child even if the database state does not
permit connections to be accepted (eg, we are in recovery mode).
The child process will correctly reject the connection and exit as
soon as it's finished collecting the connection request message.
However, this means that reaper() must be prepared to see child
process exit signals even while it's waiting for startup or shutdown
process to finish.  As was, a connection request arriving during a
database recovery or shutdown would cause postmaster abort.
