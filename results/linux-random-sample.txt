Message:
virtio: Add memory statistics reporting to the balloon driver (V4)

Changes since V3:
 - Do not do endian conversions as they will be done in the host
 - Report stats that reference a quantity of memory in bytes
 - Minor coding style updates

Changes since V2:
 - Increase stat field size to 64 bits
 - Report all sizes in kb (not pages)
 - Drop anon_pages stat and fix endianness conversion

Changes since V1:
 - Use a virtqueue instead of the device config space

When using ballooning to manage overcommitted memory on a host, a system for
guests to communicate their memory usage to the host can provide information
that will minimize the impact of ballooning on the guests.  The current method
employs a daemon running in each guest that communicates memory statistics to a
host daemon at a specified time interval.  The host daemon aggregates this
information and inflates and/or deflates balloons according to the level of
host memory pressure.  This approach is effective but overly complex since a
daemon must be installed inside each guest and coordinated to communicate with
the host.  A simpler approach is to collect memory statistics in the virtio
balloon driver and communicate them directly to the hypervisor.

This patch enables the guest-side support by adding stats collection and
reporting to the virtio balloon driver.

Message:
[SCSI] fix (unlikely) memory leak in DAC960 driver

The Coverity checker found a memory leak (bug nr. 1245) in
 drivers/block/DAC960.c::DAC960_V2_ProcessCompletedCommand()

The leak is pretty unlikely since it requires that the first of two
successive kmalloc() calls fail while the second one succeeds. But it can
still happen even if it's unlikely.

If the first call that allocates 'PhysicalDeviceInfo' fails but the one
that allocates 'InquiryUnitSerialNumber' succeeds, then we will leak the
memory allocated to 'InquiryUnitSerialNumber' when the variable goes out
of scope.

A simple fix for this is to change the existing code that frees
'PhysicalDeviceInfo' if that one was allocated but
'InquiryUnitSerialNumber' was not, into a check for either pointer
being NULL and if so just free both. This is safe since kfree() can
deal with being passed a NULL pointer and it avoids the leak.

While I was there I also removed the casts of the kmalloc() return
value since it's pointless.
I also updated the driver version since this patch changes the workings of
the code (however slightly).

This issue could probably be fixed a lot more elegantly, but the code
is a big mess IMHO and I just took the least intrusive route to a fix
that I could find instead of starting on a cleanup as well (that can
come later).

Please consider for inclusion.

Message:
Bluetooth: Fix RFCOMM release oops when device is still in use

It turns out that the following sequence of actions will reproduce the
oops:

  1. Create a new RFCOMM device (using RFCOMMCREATEDEV ioctl)
  2. (Try to) open the device
  3. Release the RFCOMM device (using RFCOMMRELEASEDEV ioctl)

At this point, the "/dev/rfcomm*" device is still in use, but it is gone
from the internal list, so the device id can be reused.

  4. Create a new RFCOMM device with the same device id as before

And now kobject will complain that the TTY already exists.

(See http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/7/13/89 for a reproducible test-case.)

This patch attempts to correct this by only removing the device from the
internal list of devices at the final unregister stage, so that the id
won't get reused until the device has been completely destructed.

This should be safe as the RFCOMM_TTY_RELEASED bit will be set for the
device and prevent the device from being reopened after it has been
released.

Message:
ACPI: ACPICA 20060623

Implemented a new acpi_spinlock type for the OSL lock
interfaces.  This allows the type to be customized to
the host OS for improved efficiency (since a spinlock is
usually a very small object.)

Implemented support for "ignored" bits in the ACPI
registers.  According to the ACPI specification, these
bits should be preserved when writing the registers via
a read/modify/write cycle. There are 3 bits preserved
in this manner: PM1_CONTROL[0] (SCI_EN), PM1_CONTROL[9],
and PM1_STATUS[11].
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3691

Implemented the initial deployment of new OSL mutex
interfaces.  Since some host operating systems have
separate mutex and semaphore objects, this feature was
requested. The base code now uses mutexes (and the new
mutex interfaces) wherever a binary semaphore was used
previously. However, for the current release, the mutex
interfaces are defined as macros to map them to the
existing semaphore interfaces.

Fixed several problems with the support for the control
method SyncLevel parameter. The SyncLevel now works
according to the ACPI specification and in concert with the
Mutex SyncLevel parameter, since the current SyncLevel is
a property of the executing thread. Mutual exclusion for
control methods is now implemented with a mutex instead
of a semaphore.

Fixed three instances of the use of the C shift operator
in the bitfield support code (exfldio.c) to avoid the use
of a shift value larger than the target data width. The
behavior of C compilers is undefined in this case and can
cause unpredictable results, and therefore the case must
be detected and avoided.  (Fiodor Suietov)

Added an info message whenever an SSDT or OEM table
is loaded dynamically via the Load() or LoadTable()
ASL operators. This should improve debugging capability
since it will show exactly what tables have been loaded
(beyond the tables present in the RSDT/XSDT.)

[PATCH] 2/5 powerpc: Rework PowerMac i2c part 2

This is the continuation of the previous patch. This one removes the old
PowerMac i2c drivers (i2c-keywest and i2c-pmac-smu) and replaces them
both with a single stub driver that uses the new PowerMac low i2c layer.

Now that i2c-keywest is gone, the low-i2c code is extended to support
interrupt driver transfers. All i2c busses now appear as platform
devices. Compatibility with existing drivers should be maintained as the
i2c bus names have been kept identical, except for the SMU bus but in
that later case, all users has been fixed.

With that patch added, matching a device node to an i2c_adapter becomes
trivial.

Message:
IPsec: correct semantics for SELinux policy matching

Currently when an IPSec policy rule doesn't specify a security
context, it is assumed to be "unlabeled" by SELinux, and so
the IPSec policy rule fails to match to a flow that it would
otherwise match to, unless one has explicitly added an SELinux
policy rule allowing the flow to "polmatch" to the "unlabeled"
IPSec policy rules. In the absence of such an explicitly added
SELinux policy rule, the IPSec policy rule fails to match and
so the packet(s) flow in clear text without the otherwise applicable
xfrm(s) applied.

The above SELinux behavior violates the SELinux security notion of
"deny by default" which should actually translate to "encrypt by
default" in the above case.

This was first reported by Evgeniy Polyakov and the way James Morris
was seeing the problem was when connecting via IPsec to a
confined service on an SELinux box (vsftpd), which did not have the
appropriate SELinux policy permissions to send packets via IPsec.

With this patch applied, SELinux "polmatching" of flows Vs. IPSec
policy rules will only come into play when there's a explicit context
specified for the IPSec policy rule (which also means there's corresponding
SELinux policy allowing appropriate domains/flows to polmatch to this context).

Secondly, when a security module is loaded (in this case, SELinux), the
security_xfrm_policy_lookup() hook can return errors other than access denied,
such as -EINVAL.  We were not handling that correctly, and in fact
inverting the return logic and propagating a false "ok" back up to
xfrm_lookup(), which then allowed packets to pass as if they were not
associated with an xfrm policy.

The solution for this is to first ensure that errno values are
correctly propagated all the way back up through the various call chains
from security_xfrm_policy_lookup(), and handled correctly.

Then, flow_cache_lookup() is modified, so that if the policy resolver
fails (typically a permission denied via the security module), the flow
cache entry is killed rather than having a null policy assigned (which
indicates that the packet can pass freely).  This also forces any future
lookups for the same flow to consult the security module (e.g. SELinux)
for current security policy (rather than, say, caching the error on the
flow cache entry).

This patch: Fix the selinux side of things.

This makes sure SELinux polmatching of flow contexts to IPSec policy
rules comes into play only when an explicit context is associated
with the IPSec policy rule.

Also, this no longer defaults the context of a socket policy to
the context of the socket since the "no explicit context" case
is now handled properly.

Message:
sched: Avoid side-effect of tickless idle on update_cpu_load

tickless idle has a negative side effect on update_cpu_load(), which
in turn can affect load balancing behavior.

update_cpu_load() is supposed to be called every tick, to keep track
of various load indicies. With tickless idle, there are no scheduler
ticks called on the idle CPUs. Idle CPUs may still do load balancing
(with idle_load_balance CPU) using the stale cpu_load. It will also
cause problems when all CPUs go idle for a while and become active
again. In this case loads would not degrade as expected.

This is how rq->nr_load_updates change looks like under different
conditions:

<cpu_num> <nr_load_updates change>
All CPUS idle for 10 seconds (HZ=1000)
0 1621
10 496
11 139
12 875
13 1672
14 12
15 21
1 1472
2 2426
3 1161
4 2108
5 1525
6 701
7 249
8 766
9 1967

One CPU busy rest idle for 10 seconds
0 10003
10 601
11 95
12 966
13 1597
14 114
15 98
1 3457
2 93
3 6679
4 1425
5 1479
6 595
7 193
8 633
9 1687

All CPUs busy for 10 seconds
0 10026
10 10026
11 10026
12 10026
13 10025
14 10025
15 10025
1 10026
2 10026
3 10026
4 10026
5 10026
6 10026
7 10026
8 10026
9 10026

That is update_cpu_load works properly only when all CPUs are busy.
If all are idle, all the CPUs get way lower updates.  And when few
CPUs are busy and rest are idle, only busy and ilb CPU does proper
updates and rest of the idle CPUs will do lower updates.

The patch keeps track of when a last update was done and fixes up
the load avg based on current time.

On one of my test system SPECjbb with warehouse 1..numcpus, patch
improves throughput numbers by ~1% (average of 6 runs).  On another
test system (with different domain hierarchy) there is no noticable
change in perf.

Message:
[XFS] 971064 Various fixups for xfs_bulkstat().

- sanity check for NULL user buffer in xfs_ioc_bulkstat[_compat]()
- remove the special case for XFS_IOC_FSBULKSTAT with count == 1. This
  special case causes bulkstat to fail because the special case uses
  xfs_bulkstat_single() instead of xfs_bulkstat() and the two functions
  have different semantics.  xfs_bulkstat() will return the next inode
  after the one supplied while skipping internal inodes (ie quota inodes).
  xfs_bulkstate_single() will only lookup the inode supplied and return
  an error if it is an internal inode.
- in xfs_bulkstat(), need to initialise 'lastino' to the inode supplied
  so in cases were we return without examining any inodes the scan wont
  restart back at zero.
- sanity check for valid *ubcountp values. Cannot sanity check for valid
  ubuffer here because some users of xfs_bulkstat() don't supply a buffer.
- checks against 'ubleft' (the space left in the user's buffer) should be
  against 'statstruct_size' which is the supplied minimum object size.
  The mixture of checks against statstruct_size and 0 was one of the
  reasons we were skipping inodes.
- if the formatter function returns BULKSTAT_RV_NOTHING and an error and
  the error is not ENOENT or EINVAL then we need to abort the scan. ENOENT
  is for inodes that are no longer valid and we just skip them. EINVAL is
  returned if we try to lookup an internal inode so we skip them too. For
  a DMF scan if the inode and DMF attribute cannot fit into the space left
  in the user's buffer it would return ERANGE. We didn't handle this error
  and skipped the inode. We would continue to skip inodes until one fitted
  into the user's buffer or we completed the scan.
- put back the recalculation of agino (that got removed with the last fix)
  at the end of the while loop. This is because the code at the start of
  the loop expects agino to be the last inode examined if it is non-zero.
- if we found some inodes but then encountered an error, return success
  this time and the error next time. If the formatter aborted with ENOMEM
  we will now return this error but only if we couldn't read any inodes.
  Previously if we encountered ENOMEM without reading any inodes we
  returned a zero count and no error which falsely indicated the scan was
  complete.

IB/ipoib: Fix thinko in packet length checks

The packet length checks in ipoib are broken: we add 4 bytes (IPoIB
encapsulation header) when sending a packet, not 20 bytes (hardware
address length) to each packet.  Therefore, if connected mode is
enabled so that the interface MTU is larger than the multicast MTU,
IPoIB may end up trying to send too-long multicast packets.  For
example, multicast is broken if a message of size 2048 bytes is sent
on an interface with UD MTU 2048, because 2048 is bigger than the real
limit of 2044 but the code tests against the wrong limit of 2060.

Message:
RDMA/cm: fix loopback address support

The RDMA CM is intended to support the use of a loopback address
when establishing a connection; however, the behavior of the CM
when loopback addresses are used is confusing and does not always
work, depending on whether loopback was specified by the server,
the client, or both.

The defined behavior of rdma_bind_addr is to associate an RDMA
device with an rdma_cm_id, as long as the user specified a non-
zero address.  (ie they weren't just trying to reserve a port)
Currently, if the loopback address is passed to rdam_bind_addr,
no device is associated with the rdma_cm_id.  Fix this.

If a loopback address is specified by the client as the destination
address for a connection, it will fail to establish a connection.
This is true even if the server is listing across all addresses or
on the loopback address itself.  The issue is that the server tries
to translate the IP address carried in the REQ message to a local
net_device address, which fails.  The translation is not needed in
this case, since the REQ carries the actual HW address that should
be used.

Finally, cleanup loopback support to be more transport neutral.
Replace separate calls to get/set the sgid and dgid from the
device address to a single call that behaves correctly depending
on the format of the device address.  And support both IPv4 and
IPv6 address formats.

eCryptfs: don't encrypt file key with filename key

eCryptfs has file encryption keys (FEK), file encryption key encryption
keys (FEKEK), and filename encryption keys (FNEK).  The per-file FEK is
encrypted with one or more FEKEKs and stored in the header of the
encrypted file.  I noticed that the FEK is also being encrypted by the
FNEK.  This is a problem if a user wants to use a different FNEK than
their FEKEK, as their file contents will still be accessible with the
FNEK.

This is a minimalistic patch which prevents the FNEKs signatures from
being copied to the inode signatures list.  Ultimately, it keeps the FEK
from being encrypted with a FNEK.

dccp ccid-2: Algorithm to update buffer state

This provides a routine to consistently update the buffer state when the
peer acknowledges receipt of Ack Vectors; updating state in the list of Ack
Vectors as well as in the circular buffer.

While based on RFC 4340, several additional (and necessary) precautions were
added to protect the consistency of the buffer state. These additions are
essential, since analysis and experience showed that the basic algorithm was
insufficient for this task (which lead to problems that were hard to debug).

The algorithm now
 * deals with HC-sender acknowledging to HC-receiver and vice versa,
 * keeps track of the last unacknowledged but received seqno in tail_ackno,
 * has special cases to reset the overflow condition when appropriate,
 * is protected against receiving older information (would mess up buffer state).

Note: The older code performed an unnecessary step, where the sender cleared
Ack Vector state by parsing the Ack Vector received by the HC-receiver. Doing
this was entirely redundant, since
 * the receiver always puts the full acknowledgment window (groups 2,3 in 11.4.2)
   into the Ack Vectors it sends; hence the HC-receiver is only interested in the
   highest state that the HC-sender received;
 * this means that the acknowledgment number on the (Data)Ack from the HC-sender
   is sufficient; and work done in parsing earlier state is not necessary, since
   the later state subsumes the  earlier one (see also RFC 4340, A.4).
This older interface (dccp_ackvec_parse()) is therefore removed.

Message:
[TCP]: Saner thash_entries default with much memory.

On systems with a very large amount of memory, the heuristics in
alloc_large_system_hash() result in a very large TCP established hash
table: 16 millions of entries for a 128 GB ia64 system. This makes
reading from /proc/net/tcp pretty slow (well over a second) and as a
result netstat is slow on these machines. I know that /proc/net/tcp is
deprecated in favor of tcp_diag, however at the moment netstat only
knows of the former.

I am skeptical that such a large TCP established hash is often needed.
Just because a system has a lot of memory doesn't imply that it will
have several millions of concurrent TCP connections. Thus I believe
that we should put an arbitrary high limit to the size of the TCP
established hash by default. Users who really need a bigger hash can
always use the thash_entries boot parameter to get more.

I propose 2 millions of entries as the arbitrary high limit. This
makes /proc/net/tcp reasonably fast on the system in question (0.2 s)
while being still large enough for me to be confident that network
performance won't suffer.

This is just one way to limit the hash size, there are others; I am not
familiar enough with the TCP code to decide which is best. Thus, I
would welcome the proposals of alternatives.

[ 2 million is still too large, thus I've modified the limit in the
  change to be '512 * 1024'. -DaveM ]

MIPS: Implement Read Inhibit/eXecute Inhibit

The SmartMIPS ASE specifies how Read Inhibit (RI) and eXecute Inhibit
(XI) bits in the page tables work.  The upper two bits of EntryLo{0,1}
are RI and XI when the feature is enabled in the PageGrain register.
SmartMIPS only covers 32-bit systems.  Cavium Octeon+ extends this to
64-bit systems by continuing to place the RI and XI bits in the top of
EntryLo even when EntryLo is 64-bits wide.

Because we need to carry the RI and XI bits in the PTE, the layout of
the PTE is changed.  There is a two instruction overhead in the TLB
refill hot path to get the EntryLo bits into the proper position.
Also the TLB load exception has to probe the TLB to check if RI or XI
caused the exception.

Also of note is that the layout of the PTE bits is done at compile and
runtime rather than statically.  In the 32-bit case this allows for
the same number of PFN bits as before the patch as the _PAGE_HUGE is
not supported in 32-bit kernels (we have _PAGE_NO_EXEC and
_PAGE_NO_READ instead of _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_HUGE).

The patch is tested on Cavium Octeon+, but should also work on 32-bit
systems with the Smart-MIPS ASE.

	http://ms-n.org/sh-linux/kernel/

More information on the board and the vendor can be obtained from the
vendor's site at:

	http://www.itonet.co.jp/

Presently supported peripherals are CF and ethernet, with support for
the on-board IDE still pending further testing.

Message:
MMC: Use timeout values from CSR

Hard-coded timeout values of 250ms for writes and 100ms for reads are
currently used for MMC transactions over SPI. The spec states that the
timeout values from the card should be used.

Merge: False
Message:
[SCSI] aacraid: initialization timeout

Received from Mark Salyzyn from Adaptec.

In the rare instances where the adapter, or the motherboard, is
misbehaving; driver initialization or shutdown becomes problematic. By
introducing a 3 minute timeout on the first interrupt driven command
during initialization, or the issuance of the adapter shutdown command
during driver unload, we can resolve the lockup problems induced by
common (but rare) hardware misbehaviors.

The timeout during initialization, should it occur, is accompanied by a
message presented to the console and the logs indicating that the user
should inspect and resolve problems with interrupt routing.
