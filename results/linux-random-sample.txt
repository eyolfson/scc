eCryptfs: don't encrypt file key with filename key

eCryptfs has file encryption keys (FEK), file encryption key encryption
keys (FEKEK), and filename encryption keys (FNEK).  The per-file FEK is
encrypted with one or more FEKEKs and stored in the header of the
encrypted file.  I noticed that the FEK is also being encrypted by the
FNEK.  This is a problem if a user wants to use a different FNEK than
their FEKEK, as their file contents will still be accessible with the
FNEK.

This is a minimalistic patch which prevents the FNEKs signatures from
being copied to the inode signatures list.  Ultimately, it keeps the FEK
from being encrypted with a FNEK.

dccp ccid-2: Algorithm to update buffer state

This provides a routine to consistently update the buffer state when the
peer acknowledges receipt of Ack Vectors; updating state in the list of Ack
Vectors as well as in the circular buffer.

While based on RFC 4340, several additional (and necessary) precautions were
added to protect the consistency of the buffer state. These additions are
essential, since analysis and experience showed that the basic algorithm was
insufficient for this task (which lead to problems that were hard to debug).

The algorithm now
 * deals with HC-sender acknowledging to HC-receiver and vice versa,
 * keeps track of the last unacknowledged but received seqno in tail_ackno,
 * has special cases to reset the overflow condition when appropriate,
 * is protected against receiving older information (would mess up buffer state).

Note: The older code performed an unnecessary step, where the sender cleared
Ack Vector state by parsing the Ack Vector received by the HC-receiver. Doing
this was entirely redundant, since
 * the receiver always puts the full acknowledgment window (groups 2,3 in 11.4.2)
   into the Ack Vectors it sends; hence the HC-receiver is only interested in the
   highest state that the HC-sender received;
 * this means that the acknowledgment number on the (Data)Ack from the HC-sender
   is sufficient; and work done in parsing earlier state is not necessary, since
   the later state subsumes the  earlier one (see also RFC 4340, A.4).
This older interface (dccp_ackvec_parse()) is therefore removed.

Message:
[TCP]: Saner thash_entries default with much memory.

On systems with a very large amount of memory, the heuristics in
alloc_large_system_hash() result in a very large TCP established hash
table: 16 millions of entries for a 128 GB ia64 system. This makes
reading from /proc/net/tcp pretty slow (well over a second) and as a
result netstat is slow on these machines. I know that /proc/net/tcp is
deprecated in favor of tcp_diag, however at the moment netstat only
knows of the former.

I am skeptical that such a large TCP established hash is often needed.
Just because a system has a lot of memory doesn't imply that it will
have several millions of concurrent TCP connections. Thus I believe
that we should put an arbitrary high limit to the size of the TCP
established hash by default. Users who really need a bigger hash can
always use the thash_entries boot parameter to get more.

I propose 2 millions of entries as the arbitrary high limit. This
makes /proc/net/tcp reasonably fast on the system in question (0.2 s)
while being still large enough for me to be confident that network
performance won't suffer.

This is just one way to limit the hash size, there are others; I am not
familiar enough with the TCP code to decide which is best. Thus, I
would welcome the proposals of alternatives.

[ 2 million is still too large, thus I've modified the limit in the
  change to be '512 * 1024'. -DaveM ]

crypto: des_s390: remove des3_ede128 mode

des_s390 implements support for 3DES with a 128 bit key. This mode is probably
not used anywhere, less secure than 3DES with a 192 bit key and not
implemented in the generic des version. Removing this mode seems to be low risk
and will ease maintenance of the code.

Message:
MIPS: Implement Read Inhibit/eXecute Inhibit

The SmartMIPS ASE specifies how Read Inhibit (RI) and eXecute Inhibit
(XI) bits in the page tables work.  The upper two bits of EntryLo{0,1}
are RI and XI when the feature is enabled in the PageGrain register.
SmartMIPS only covers 32-bit systems.  Cavium Octeon+ extends this to
64-bit systems by continuing to place the RI and XI bits in the top of
EntryLo even when EntryLo is 64-bits wide.

Because we need to carry the RI and XI bits in the PTE, the layout of
the PTE is changed.  There is a two instruction overhead in the TLB
refill hot path to get the EntryLo bits into the proper position.
Also the TLB load exception has to probe the TLB to check if RI or XI
caused the exception.

Also of note is that the layout of the PTE bits is done at compile and
runtime rather than statically.  In the 32-bit case this allows for
the same number of PFN bits as before the patch as the _PAGE_HUGE is
not supported in 32-bit kernels (we have _PAGE_NO_EXEC and
_PAGE_NO_READ instead of _PAGE_READ and _PAGE_HUGE).

The patch is tested on Cavium Octeon+, but should also work on 32-bit
systems with the Smart-MIPS ASE.

sh: SH-2007 board support.

This patch series adds support for ITO Co., Ltd.'s SH-2007 reference
platform (A PC-104 based SH7780 platform).

This is a direct port of the out-of-tree board support from the vendor's
kernel, originally located at:

	http://ms-n.org/sh-linux/kernel/

More information on the board and the vendor can be obtained from the
vendor's site at:

	http://www.itonet.co.jp/

Presently supported peripherals are CF and ethernet, with support for
the on-board IDE still pending further testing.

Message:
[SCSI] aacraid: initialization timeout

Received from Mark Salyzyn from Adaptec.

In the rare instances where the adapter, or the motherboard, is
misbehaving; driver initialization or shutdown becomes problematic. By
introducing a 3 minute timeout on the first interrupt driven command
during initialization, or the issuance of the adapter shutdown command
during driver unload, we can resolve the lockup problems induced by
common (but rare) hardware misbehaviors.

The timeout during initialization, should it occur, is accompanied by a
message presented to the console and the logs indicating that the user
should inspect and resolve problems with interrupt routing.
