iwlwifi: fix ICT irq table endianness

The ICT IRQ table is a set of __le32 values, not u32 values,
so when reading it we need to take into account that it has
to be converted to CPU endianness. This was causing a lot of
trouble on my powerpc box where various things would simply
not work for no apparent reason with 5xxx cards, but worked
with 4965 -- which doesn't use the ICT table.

rtc: v3020: fix v3020_mmio_read_bit()

v3020_mmio_read_bit() always returns 0 when left_shift > 7.

v3020_mmio_read_bit()'s return type is (unsigned char).  The code returns
a value masked by (1 << left_shift) that is casted to the return type.  If
left_shift is larger than 7, the cast will always result in a 0 return
value.  The problem was discovered with left_shift = 16, and the included
patch corrects the problem.

The bug was introduced in the last (Apr 3 2009) commit of the file, kernel
versions 2.6.30 and later.

* Use I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX instead of hardcoding 32.
* Discard extra blank lines.
* Use boolean not instead of bitwise not for bit tests, it's clearer.
* Return -EBUSY rather than -1 on I/O resource conflict.

fs: new inode i_state corruption fix

There was a report of a data corruption
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/14/121.  There is a script included to
reproduce the problem.

During testing, I encountered a number of strange things with ext3, so I
tried ext2 to attempt to reduce complexity of the problem.  I found that
fsstress would quickly hang in wait_on_inode, waiting for I_LOCK to be
cleared, even though instrumentation showed that unlock_new_inode had
already been called for that inode.  This points to memory scribble, or
synchronisation problme.

i_state of I_NEW inodes is not protected by inode_lock because other
processes are not supposed to touch them until I_LOCK (and I_NEW) is
cleared.  Adding WARN_ON(inode->i_state & I_NEW) to sites where we modify
i_state revealed that generic_sync_sb_inodes is picking up new inodes from
the inode lists and passing them to __writeback_single_inode without
waiting for I_NEW.  Subsequently modifying i_state causes corruption.  In
my case it would look like this:

CPU0                            CPU1
unlock_new_inode()              __sync_single_inode()
 reg <- inode->i_state
 reg -> reg & ~(I_LOCK|I_NEW)   reg <- inode->i_state
 reg -> inode->i_state          reg -> reg | I_SYNC
                                reg -> inode->i_state

Non-atomic RMW on CPU1 overwrites CPU0 store and sets I_LOCK|I_NEW again.

Fix for this is rather than wait for I_NEW inodes, just skip over them:
inodes concurrently being created are not subject to data integrity
operations, and should not significantly contribute to dirty memory
either.

After this change, I'm unable to reproduce any of the added warnings or
hangs after ~1hour of running.  Previously, the new warnings would start
immediately and hang would happen in under 5 minutes.

I'm also testing on ext3 now, and so far no problems there either.  I
don't know whether this fixes the problem reported above, but it fixes a
real problem for me.

Message:
cpusets: update task's cpus_allowed and mems_allowed after CPU/NODE offline/online

The bug is that a task may run on the cpu/node which is not in its
cpuset.cpus/ cpuset.mems.

It can be reproduced by the following commands:
-----------------------------------
# mkdir /dev/cpuset
# mount -t cpuset xxx /dev/cpuset
# mkdir /dev/cpuset/0
# echo 0-1 > /dev/cpuset/0/cpus
# echo 0 > /dev/cpuset/0/mems
# echo $$ > /dev/cpuset/0/tasks
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
-----------------------------------

There is only CPU0 in cpuset.cpus, but the task in this cpuset runs on
both CPU0 and CPU1.

It is because the task's cpu_allowed didn't get updated after we did CPU
offline/online manipulation.  Similar for mem_allowed.

This patch fixes this bug expect for root cpuset.  Because there is a
problem about root cpuset, in that whether it is necessary to update all
the tasks in root cpuset or not after cpu/node offline/online.

If updating, some kernel threads which is bound into a specified cpu will
be unbound.

If not updating, there is a bug in root cpuset.  This bug is also caused
by offline/online manipulation.  For example, there is a dual-cpu machine.
 we create a sub cpuset in root cpuset and assign 1 to its cpus.  And then
we attach some tasks into this sub cpuset.  After this, we offline CPU1.
Now, the tasks in this new cpuset are moved into root cpuset automatically
because there is no cpu in sub cpuset.  Then we online CPU1, we find all
the tasks which doesn't belong to root cpuset originally just run on CPU0.

Maybe we need to add a flag in the task_struct to mark which task can't be
unbound?

powerpc: Fix 64bit memcpy() regression

This fixes a regression introduced by commit
25d6e2d7c58ddc4a3b614fc5381591c0cfe66556 ("powerpc: Update 64bit memcpy()
using CPU_FTR_UNALIGNED_LD_STD").

This commit allowed CPUs that have the CPU_FTR_UNALIGNED_LD_STD CPU
feature bit present to do the memcpy() with unaligned load doubles. But,
along with this came a bug where our final load double would read bytes
beyond a page boundary and into the next (unmapped) page. This was caught
by enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC,

The fix was to read only the number of bytes that we need to store rather
than reading a full 8-byte doubleword and storing only a portion of that.

In order to minimise the amount of existing code touched we use the
original do_tail for the src_unaligned case.

Below is an example of the regression, as reported by Sachin Sant:

Message:
[CIFS] Always match oplock break (cache notification) to the right tcp
session when multiply mounted.

Fixes slow response when cifs client is mounted to shares on multiple
servers and oplock break occurs (usually due to attempt to multiply open a
file).  When treeids on mutiple mounted shares match and we find the wrong
match first, we searched for the wrong cached files to send oplock break
response for which usually meant that no matching file was found and thus
the server would have to timeout the notification.  Oplock break timeout is
about 20 seconds on some servers so this could cause significantly slower
performance on file open calls in a few cases (in particular when multiple
shares are mounted from multiple servers, tree ids match, and we have a
cached file which is later opened multiple times).  This was the most
important of the bugs that was found and fixed at Connectathon
(interoperability testing event) this week.

mac80211: Add RTNL version of ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces

Since commit e38bad4766a110b61fa6038f10be16ced8c6cc38
	mac80211: make ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces not need rtnl
rt2500usb and rt73usb broke down due to attempting register access
in atomic context (which is not possible for USB hardware).

This patch restores ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces() to use RTNL lock,
and provides the non-RTNL version under a new name:
	ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces_atomic()

So far only rt2x00 uses ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces(), and those
drivers require the RTNL version of ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces().
Since they already call that function directly, this patch will automatically
fix the USB rt2x00 drivers.

v2: Rename ieee80211_iterate_active_interfaces_rtnl

atmel_serial: filter out FP during baud rate detection

I made a change to u-boot that used the FP (Fractional Part) field of BRGR
to achieve more accurate baud rate generation.  Unfortunately, the
atmel_serial driver looks at the whole BRGR register when trying to detect
the baud rate that the port is currently running at, so setting FP to a
nonzero value breaks the baud rate detection.

I'll sit on the u-boot patch for a while longer, but this is clearly a
bug in the atmel_serial driver which should be fixed.

ARM: mach-shmobile: ap4evb: Fix hotplug for SDHI1

On AP4EVB the card detect pin of the top SD/MMC slot is not directly
connected to the tmio/mmcif controller but to a GPIO pin, so polling
needs to be done for SDHI1 and MMCIF in order to support hotplug for
that slot. SHDI1 and MMCIF share that slot, and the used controller
is selected by a DIP switch.
This patch adds a helper function to check if a card is present in that
particular slot, registers this function with SDHI1 and MMCIF and enables
polling for SDHI1.

x86, ioapic: Document another case when level irq is seen as an edge

In the case when cpu goes offline, fixup_irqs() will forward any
unhandled interrupt on the offlined cpu to the new cpu
destination that is handling the corresponding interrupt. This
interrupt forwarding is done via IPI's. Hence, in this case also
level-triggered io-apic interrupt will be seen as an edge
interrupt in the cpu's APIC IRR.

Document this scenario in the code which handles this case by doing
an explicit EOI to the io-apic to clear remote IRR of the io-apic RTE.

sh: nommu: Support building without an uncached mapping.

Now that nommu selects 32BIT we run in to the situation where SH-2A
supports an uncached identity mapping by way of the BSC, while the SH-2
does not. This provides stubs for the PC manglers and tidies up some of
the system*.h mess in the process.

[POWERPC] spufs: invalidate SLB translation before adding a new entry

When we replace an SLB entry in the MFC after using up all the available
entries, there is a short window in which an incorrect entry is marked
as valid.

The problem is that the 'valid' bit is stored in the ESID, which is
always written after the VSID. Overwriting the VSID first will make the
original ESID entry point to the new VSID, which means that any
concurrent DMA accessing the old ESID ends up being redirected to the
new virtual address.  A few cycles later, we write the new ESID and
everything is fine again.

That race can be closed by writing a zero entry to the ESID first, which
makes sure that the VSID is not accessed until we write the new ESID.

Note that we don't actually need to invalidate the SLB entry using the
invalidation register, which would also flush any ERAT entries for that
segment, because the segment translation does not become invalid but is
only removed from the SLB cache.

filesystem freeze: allow SysRq emergency thaw to thaw frozen filesystems

Now that the filesystem freeze operation has been elevated to the VFS, and
is just an ioctl away, some sort of safety net for unintentionally frozen
root filesystems may be in order.

The timeout thaw originally proposed did not get merged, but perhaps
something like this would be useful in emergencies.

For example, freeze /path/to/mountpoint may freeze your root filesystem if
you forgot that you had that unmounted.

I chose 'j' as the last remaining character other than 'h' which is sort
of reserved for help (because help is generated on any unknown character).

I've tested this on a non-root fs with multiple (nested) freezers, as well
as on a system rendered unresponsive due to a frozen root fs.

USB Storage Sierra: TRU-Install feature update

This patch upgrades the support for the Sierra Wireless TRU-Install
feature (i.e. zeroCD) to allow for future support of Linux enabled
TRU-Install devices.

By default all devices that do not have a Linux enabled TRU-Install
device (i.e. the device does not have a Linux package on the virtual CD
partition) will be switched into "modem mode." Devices that do contain a
Linux package in the TRU-Install virtual CD will be allowed to enumerate
as a CD-Rom so that either (a) a user can install the packaged software
or (b) a user-space application (e.g. udev) can switch it to modem mode.

This patch does allow for manual override by adding a usb-storage module
parameter 'swi_tru_install' which can force the modem into either mode
regardless of what packages it contains.

kbuild: enable 'make AFLAGS=...' to add additional options to AS

The variable AFLAGS is a wellknown variable and the usage by
kbuild may result in unexpected behaviour.
On top of that several people over time has asked for a way to
pass in additional flags to gcc.

This patch replace use of AFLAGS with KBUILD_AFLAGS all over
the tree.

Patch was tested on following architectures:
alpha, arm, i386, x86_64, mips, sparc, sparc64, ia64, m68k, s390

[PATCH] USBATM: xusbatm rewrite

The xusbatm driver is for otherwise unsupported modems.
All it does is grab hold of a user-specified set of
interfaces - the generic usbatm core methods (hopefully)
do the rest.  As Aurelio Arroyo discovered when he tried
to use xusbatm (big mistake!), the interface grabbing logic
was completely borked.  Here is a rewrite that works.

libertas: Increase priority of 'unknown command' warnings

Using the deprecated lbs_prepare_and_send_command() function for a
command which it doesn't understand is an error; complain loudly about
it even when we're not debugging.

The mesh stats bug, where we converted MESH_ACCESS to a direct command
but accidentally missed one user which was still trying to do it through
lbs_prepare_and_send_command(), would have been caught a lot quicker if
we'd done this sooner. Such bugs aren't entirely unlikely in future too,
as we convert more code to stop using this function.

[PATCH] knfsd: nfsd4: simplify lease changing

The only way the protocol gives to change the lease time on the fly is to
simulate a reboot.  We don't have that completely right in the current code;
among other things, we should probably put lockd in grace too while we do
this.

For now, let's just keep this simple, and wait till the next time nfsd starts
to register any changes in lease time.  If the administrator really wants to
change the lease time *now*, they can go ahead and bring nfsd down and then
back up again after changing the lease time.

Also remove the "if (reclaim_str_hashtbl_size == 0)" case, a shortcut which
skips the grace period if we know of no clients in need of recovery.  This
isn't going to work well with nlm.

[PATCH] x86-64: update IO-APIC dest field to 8-bit for xAPIC

On the Unisys ES7000/ONE system, we encountered a problem where performing
a kexec reboot or dump on any cell other than cell 0 causes the system
timer to stop working, resulting in a hang during timer calibration in the
new kernel.

We traced the problem to one line of code in disable_IO_APIC(), which needs
to restore the timer's IO-APIC configuration before rebooting.  The code is
currently using the 4-bit physical destination field, rather than using the
8-bit logical destination field, and it cuts off the upper 4 bits of the
timer's APIC ID.  If we change this to use the logical destination field,
the timer works and we can kexec on the upper cells.  This was tested on
two different cells (0 and 2) in an ES7000/ONE system.

For reference, the relevant Intel xAPIC spec is kept at
ftp://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/e8501/datashts/30962001.pdf,
specifically on page 334.

USB: usb_serial: only allow sysrq on a console port

The only time a sysrq should get processed is if the attached device
is a console.  This is intended to protect sysrq execution on a host
connected with a terminal program.

Here is the problem scenario:

host A <-- rs232 link --> host B

Host A is using mincom and a usb pl2303 device to connect to host b
which is a linux system with a usb pl2303 device acting as the serial
console.  When host B is rebooted the pl2303 emits random junk
characters on reset.  These character sequences contain serial break
signals most of the time and when translated to a sysrq have caused
host A to get random processes killed, reboots or power down.

It is true that in this setup with this patch host B might still have
the same problem as host A if you reboot host A.  In most cases host A
is a development host which seldom gets rebooted, and you could turn
off sysrq temporarily on host B if you need to reboot host A.

[PATCH] stale POSIX lock handling

I believe that there is a problem with the handling of POSIX locks, which
the attached patch should address.

The problem appears to be a race between fcntl(2) and close(2).  A
multithreaded application could close a file descriptor at the same time as
it is trying to acquire a lock using the same file descriptor.  I would
suggest that that multithreaded application is not providing the proper
synchronization for itself, but the OS should still behave correctly.

SUS3 (Single UNIX Specification Version 3, read: POSIX) indicates that when
a file descriptor is closed, that all POSIX locks on the file, owned by the
process which closed the file descriptor, should be released.

The trick here is when those locks are released.  The current code releases
all locks which exist when close is processing, but any locks in progress
are handled when the last reference to the open file is released.

There are three cases to consider.

One is the simple case, a multithreaded (mt) process has a file open and
races to close it and acquire a lock on it.  In this case, the close will
release one reference to the open file and when the fcntl is done, it will
release the other reference.  For this situation, no locks should exist on
the file when both the close and fcntl operations are done.  The current
system will handle this case because the last reference to the open file is
being released.

The second case is when the mt process has dup(2)'d the file descriptor.
The close will release one reference to the file and the fcntl, when done,
will release another, but there will still be at least one more reference
to the open file.  One could argue that the existence of a lock on the file
after the close has completed is okay, because it was acquired after the
close operation and there is still a way for the application to release the
lock on the file, using an existing file descriptor.

The third case is when the mt process has forked, after opening the file
and either before or after becoming an mt process.  In this case, each
process would hold a reference to the open file.  For each process, this
degenerates to first case above.  However, the lock continues to exist
until both processes have released their references to the open file.  This
lock could block other lock requests.

The changes to release the lock when the last reference to the open file
aren't quite right because they would allow the lock to exist as long as
there was a reference to the open file.  This is too long.

The new proposed solution is to add support in the fcntl code path to
detect a race with close and then to release the lock which was just
acquired when such as race is detected.  This causes locks to be released
in a timely fashion and for the system to conform to the POSIX semantic
specification.

This was tested by instrumenting a kernel to detect the handling locks and
then running a program which generates case #3 above.  A dangling lock
could be reliably generated.  When the changes to detect the close/fcntl
race were added, a dangling lock could no longer be generated.

$ modprobe ubi mtd=/dev/mtd0

to attach /dev/mtd0.

[PATCH] x86: remove locally-defined ldt structure in favour of standard type

arch/i386/kernel/reboot.c defines its own struct to describe an ldt entry: it
should use struct Xgt_desc_struct (currently load_ldt is a macro, so doesn't
complain: paravirt patches make it warn).
