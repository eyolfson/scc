Message:
Suppress timezone (%Z) part of timestamp display when running on Windows,
because on that platform strftime produces localized zone names in varying
encodings.  Even though it's only in a comment, this can cause encoding
errors when reloading the dump script.  Per suggestion from Andreas
Seltenreich.  Also, suppress %Z on Windows in the %s escape of
log_line_prefix ... not sure why this one is different from the other two,
but it shouldn't be.

Commit: 7c13781ee7a617235f24617e3bd7628cda95df15
Message:
First phase of project to use fixed OIDs for all system catalogs and
indexes.  Extend the macros in include/catalog/*.h to carry the info
about hand-assigned OIDs, and adjust the genbki script and bootstrap
code to make the relations actually get those OIDs.  Remove the small
number of RelOid_pg_foo macros that we had in favor of a complete
set named like the catname.h and indexing.h macros.  Next phase will
get rid of internal use of names for looking up catalogs and indexes;
but this completes the changes forcing an initdb, so it looks like a
good place to commit.
Along the way, I made the shared relations (pg_database etc) not be
'bootstrap' relations any more, so as to reduce the number of hardwired
entries and simplify changing those relations in future.  I'm not
sure whether they ever really needed to be handled as bootstrap
relations, but it seems to work fine to not do so now.

Message:
Kris Jurka pointed out that the qualified_name production wasn't
working as intended --- for some reason, FROM a.b.c was getting
parsed as if it were a function name and not a qualified name.
I think there must be a bug in bison, because it should have
complained that the grammar was ambiguous.  Anyway, fix it along
the same lines previously used for func_name vs columnref, and get
rid of the right-recursion in attrs that seems to have confused
bison.

Commit: 98f27aaef34291246c09ce5d0e0fba4f4477467a
Message:
Fix assorted security-grade bugs in the regex engine.  All of these problems
are shared with Tcl, since it's their code to begin with, and the patches
have been copied from Tcl 8.5.0.  Problems:

CVE-2007-4769: Inadequate check on the range of backref numbers allows
crash due to out-of-bounds read.
CVE-2007-4772: Infinite loop in regex optimizer for pattern '($|^)*'.
CVE-2007-6067: Very slow optimizer cleanup for regex with a large NFA
representation, as well as crash if we encounter an out-of-memory condition
during NFA construction.

Part of the response to CVE-2007-6067 is to put a limit on the number of
states in the NFA representation of a regex.  This seems needed even though
the within-the-code problems have been corrected, since otherwise the code
could try to use very large amounts of memory for a suitably-crafted regex,
leading to potential DOS by driving the system into swap, activating a kernel
OOM killer, etc.

Although there are certainly plenty of ways to drive the system into effective
DOS with poorly-written SQL queries, these problems seem worth treating as
security issues because many applications might accept regex search patterns
from untrustworthy sources.

Thanks to Will Drewry of Google for reporting these problems.  Patches by Will
Drewry and Tom Lane.

Message:
Rewrite ProcessConfigFile() to avoid misbehavior at EOF, as per report
from Andrus Moor.  The former state-machine-style coding wasn't actually
doing much except obscuring the control flow, and it didn't extend
readily to fix this case, so I just took it out.  Also, add a
YY_FLUSH_BUFFER call to ensure the lexer is reset correctly if the
previous scan failed partway through the file.

Commit: 843657b06656c66fdf5fb45588a1e0691d9a395d
Message:
attached is take-2 of a patch which fixes a bug related
to the use of getpwuid when running in standalone mode.
this patch allocates some persistent storage (using
strdup) to store the username obtained with getpwuid
in src/backend/main/main.c.  this is necessary because
later on, getpwuid is called again (in ValidateBinary).

the man pages for getpwuid on SCO OpenServer, FreeBSD,
and Darwin all have words to this effect (this is from
the SCO OpenServer man page):

  Note
  ====
  All information is contained in a static area, so it must
  be copied if it is to be saved. Otherwise, it may be
  overwritten on subsequent calls to these routines.

in particular, on my platform, the storage used to hold
the pw_name from the first call is overwritten such that
it looks like an empty username.  this causes a problem
later on in SetSessionUserIdFromUserName.

i'd assume this isn't a problem on most platforms because
getpwuid is called with the same UID both times, and the
same thing ends up happening to that static storage each
time.  however, that's not guaranteed, and is _not_ what
happens on my platform (at least :).

this is for the version of 7.1 available via anon cvs as
of Tue Jan 23 15:14:00 2001 PST:

Now that hashjoin is reliable for large joins (knock on wood),
remove optimizer's arbitrary limit on how large a join it will use hashing
for.  (The limit was too large to prevent the problems we'd been seeing,
anyway...)

Merge: False
Message:
It looks like the multibyte regress tests only work if both
the database encoding and the client encoding match the encoding expected
by the test.  So, force both of them to be set from the MULTIBYTE
environment var.  This allows regress tests to be run successfully in
multibyte environments other than the compiled-in default.

Commit: 9b8a73326e99821caf33c36c081cb307e17422d4
Merge: False
Message:
Introduce wal_level GUC to explicitly control if information needed for
archival or hot standby should be WAL-logged, instead of deducing that from
other options like archive_mode. This replaces recovery_connections GUC in
the primary, where it now has no effect, but it's still used in the standby
to enable/disable hot standby.

Remove the WAL-logging of "unlogged operations", like creating an index
without WAL-logging and fsyncing it at the end. Instead, we keep a copy of
the wal_mode setting and the settings that affect how much shared memory a
hot standby server needs to track master transactions (max_connections,
max_prepared_xacts, max_locks_per_xact) in pg_control. Whenever the settings
change, at server restart, write a WAL record noting the new settings and
update pg_control. This allows us to notice the change in those settings in
the standby at the right moment, they used to be included in checkpoint
records, but that meant that a changed value was not reflected in the
standby until the first checkpoint after the change.

Bump PG_CONTROL_VERSION and XLOG_PAGE_MAGIC. Whack XLOG_PAGE_MAGIC back to
the sequence it used to follow, before hot standby and subsequent patches
changed it to 0x9003.

Message:
Adjust constant-folding of CASE expressions so that the simple comparison
form of CASE (eg, CASE 0 WHEN 1 THEN ...) can be constant-folded as it
was in 7.4.  Also, avoid constant-folding result expressions that are
certainly unreachable --- the former coding was a bit cavalier about this
and could generate unexpected results for all-constant CASE expressions.
Add regression test cases.  Per report from Vlad Marchenko.

Merge: False
Message:
Avoid memory leak if pgstat_vacuum_stat is interrupted partway through.
The temporary hash tables made by pgstat_collect_oids should be allocated
in a short-term memory context, which is not the default behavior of
hash_create.  Noted while looking through hash_create calls in connection
with Robert Haas' recent complaint.

This is a pre-existing bug, but it doesn't seem important enough to
back-patch.  The hash table is not so large that it would matter unless this
happened many times within a session, which seems quite unlikely.
