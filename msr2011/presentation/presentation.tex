\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Motivation}
  
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Software repositories contain a wealth of information

    \begin{itemize}

      \item What's available?

      \item Is it possible to leverage this data?

      \item What could we learn?

    \end{itemize}

    \item Can also create connections between bug introductions and fixes

    \item We intend to find correlations for these ``buggy'' commits

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Experimental Methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Creating Connections}
  
  \begin{itemize}

    \item Find the bug fixing commits (keyword search) and for each

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Find lines which changed

      \item Use ``blame'' to find which commit(s) caused the bug

      \item Record information to database
    \end{itemize}

    \item Keyword search precision of 86\%--87\% and recall of 71\%--73\%

    \item Additional information is available

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Additional Information}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Record the following

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Commit times (local and UTC)

      \item Number of lines changed in code/comments/other in commit

      \item Merge authors with same name/email
    \end{itemize}

    \item We can now determine    
  
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Developer experience

        \item Bug lifetime

        \item Whether a commit contains a bug and how many fixes were applied
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

      First commit & April 16, 2005 & July 9, 1996 \\
      Last commit & Nov. 21, 2010 & Jan. 24, 2011 \\
      Lines of code & over 5 million & over 750,000 \\

      Fixing commits & 57,028 & 4,399
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Note: results on website have better author merging and minor
                improvements

\section{Related Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Previous Studies}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Commits for Eclipse and Mozilla were found to be buggiest on Fridays \cite{sliwerski-msr-2005}

    \item Classification of commits into different categories \cite{largeCommits}

    \item Bug lifetimes for Linux and PostgreSQL \cite{deviant,2006-long}

    \item We found average buglifetimes of

    \begin{itemize}
      \item 1.38 years ($\sigma = 1.35$) for Linux

      \item 3.07 years ($\sigma = 3.19$) for PostgreSQL
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Summary of Findings}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Commits between midnight and 4 AM are more likely to be buggy

    \item Commits between 7 AM and noon are less likely to be buggy

    \item More active developers commit less bugs

    \item More experienced developers commit less bugs

    \item The worst day of the week varies between projects
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{For the Future}

  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Study individual developers
   
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Are commits outside their normal schedule worse?

      \item Experience including other open-source projects?
    \end{itemize}

    \item More software projects

    \item Correlations involving code quality

    \item Data is now broswable at \url{http://www.eyolfson.com/scc/}
